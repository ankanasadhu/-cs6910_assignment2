# Deep Learning Assignment 2

* This assignment consisted of the following 3 parts:
* Part A : Building and training a CNN model from scratch using keras and tensorflow.
* Part B : Using various pre trained models and fine tuning them using same data used to train the basic CNN model and compare the results.
* Part C : Using YOLOv3 model to make a cool application.

### The readme files for each part is in its respective folders in this repo which can be viewed to see more about how the work was done.
