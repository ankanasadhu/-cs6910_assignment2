# Deep Learning Assignment 2

* This assignment consisted of the following 3 parts:
* Part A : Building and training a CNN model from scratch using keras and tensorflow.
* Part B : Using an existing pre trained model to the same data used to train the basic CNN model and compare the results of testing with the model that we created in Part A.
* Part C : Using YOLOv3 model to make a cool application.

## The readme files for each part is in its respective folders in this repo which can be viewed to see more about how the work was done.
